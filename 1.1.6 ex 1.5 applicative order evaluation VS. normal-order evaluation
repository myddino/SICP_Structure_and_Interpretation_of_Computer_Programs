applicative order evaluation

(define (p) (p))

For applicative order evaluation: (test 0 (p)) => infinite loop
The arguments are evaluated before the body of the procedure is executed.


normal order evaluation

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))

For normal order evaluation: (test 0 (p)) => 0
The arguments are evaluated when they are used within the body of the procedure.

Using normal-order evaluation, the expression evaluates, step by step, to 0:

 (test 0 (p)) 
  
 (if (= 0 0) 0 (p)) 
  
 (if #t 0 (p)) 
  
 0
